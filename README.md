Simple UI front end for the offical Bedrock Server software, which runs in a console window.

Download the zip file from Releases and copy the two files (the server manager exe and its config file) into the same folder bedrock_server.exe

Run it and click "Start Server" to start up your Minecraft server. Do not start the Minecraft Bedrock Server console exe first (unless you want more than one instance for some reason). Server Manager starts the server, keeps it hidden and allows you to manage it via the UI.
