Simple UI front end for the offical Bedrock Server software, which runs in a console window. Install that first (link at the bottom of this readme).

Next, download the zip file from the latest release:

https://github.com/simontims/Minecraft-Server-Manager/releases

Extract the two files (the server manager exe itself, and its config file) into the same folder as bedrock_server.exe

Run it and click "Start Server" to start up your Minecraft server. Do not start the Minecraft Bedrock Server console exe first (unless you want more than one instance for some reason). Server Manager starts the server, keeps it hidden and allows you to manage it via the UI.

The Login and Welcome messages are both displayed (login message first) 10 seconds after a user joins the server, to give the client time to complete their login. Both support the inclusion of the player name in the text by including {playerName} where you want it to appear.
