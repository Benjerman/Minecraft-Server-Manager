Just place the "Minecraft Server Manager.exe" and config file in your minecraft bedrock server folder, then run it and click "Start Server" to start up your minecraft server. You can change how often the server runs backups by changing the value of "backupInterval" in your "Minecraft Server Manager.exe.config" to your desired number of minutes
