Place "Minecraft Server Manager.exe" and its config file in your Minecraft Bedrock Server Folder. Run it and click "Start Server" to start up your Minecraft server. Do not start the Minecraft Bedrock Server exe first (unless you want more than one instance for some reason). Server Manager starts the CMD server window, keeps it hidden and manages it for you.
